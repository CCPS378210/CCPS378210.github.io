    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>The things I am working on in my personal and professional life are working to get better study skills,  and most important for me is Testing skills. I have always struggled to find the best way to study for a quiz or test. I am hoping I can get better at that by doing more studying and maybe asking around to see what testing methods works best for other people. One major thing I would like to go forward in is getting a degree in Travel ultrasound Tech .I have always been really into being some sort of nurse/doctor. I love helping out with children, and I feel that being an ultrasound tech would be the best fit for me. I am doing many things to work towards this goal such as looking into it, studying books on it, and most importantly taking the classes I need to be an ultrasound tech. There are many good values you need to accomplish my goal and I feel that I have many of them such as having a flexibility of the mind and personality. You must also deal with stress in an appropriate manner. Short term goals that I will need to fix before I accomplish my big goals are having good test taking strategies and studying strategies. I need to have good testing strategies and studying strategies  because I need to be able to learn what I need to know to be a Ultrasound Tech. I would like to be known for My abilities to Cope with my own stress in appropriate ways and also help others with that. I am a patient problem solver and take genuine care of people. I can adapt to places and people very fast as well. Overall I feel that I am a calm, and stress free person to be around.</p>
